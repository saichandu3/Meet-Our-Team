# Meet-Our-Team
I designed and developed this fully responsive "Meet Our Team" page using modern web technologies: HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a professional, engaging, and visually appealing way to introduce a team of professionals.
Elegant, Modern UI: I chose a sophisticated dark theme with a vibrant purple gradient accent to make the design stand out. This color palette gives the page a sleek and professional feel.

Responsive Card Layout: Each team member is featured in a clean, well-structured card. The layout is built using a modern CSS approach (likely Flexbox or Grid) to ensure it adapts seamlessly and looks great on any device, from large desktop screens to mobile phones.

Dynamic Hover Effects: I implemented subtle hover effects on the cards to provide a more interactive and polished user experience.

Clear Information Hierarchy: Each card presents the team member's name, job title, and a brief biography in a clear and readable format. The circular profile pictures add a personal touch.

Social Media Integration: The inclusion of social media icons (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub) at the bottom of each card makes it easy for visitors to connect with the team members.

Call-to-Action (CTA): The page concludes with a clear and inviting "Want to join our team?" section, which encourages potential applicants to engage with the company.
